Definitions,,,,,
Household Income from Work:,,,,,
"Refers to the sum of income received by employed members of the household from employment and business. However, it does not include the income of domestic workers. Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of the annual bonus. Data on household income from work refer to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise. As the income data pertain to income from work, the coverage of households is based on resident employed households. Data on household income are based on the sample of households surveyed in the June Comprehensive Labour Force Surveys conducted by the Ministry of Manpower every year, except for 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020 which are based on the Censuses of Population and the mid-decade General Household Survey. The income estimates are based on income as reported by survey respondents and augmented with administrative data. Survey estimates are subject to sampling variability.",,,,,
